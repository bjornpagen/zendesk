Below is a practical breakdown of the key inbound Postmark fields you’re likely to parse and store in your database. This focuses on the essentials needed to match (or create) the correct customer and thread, persist the message and content, and handle responses from your help desk UI. Since staff always respond in the web UI, your main goal is to capture the inbound email details so you can display them to agents and associate them with the correct thread.

## 1) Identifying the Customer

• From / FromName / FromFull
  - “FromFull.Email” contains the sender’s email address (e.g. myUser@theirDomain.com).
  - “FromFull.Name” can help you set or update the Customer’s name.
  - You’ll typically look up an existing customer row by email address, or create a new one if none exists.

## 2) Connecting to the Right Thread

• Subject
  - Often helps find or create a “thread” record (e.g. if you parse out a token embedded in the subject).
  - You can store it in the threads.subject column if you are creating a brand‐new thread.

• MailboxHash
  - If you use plus‐addressing (like 451d9b70cf9364d23ff6f9d51d870251569e+ahoy@inbound.postmarkapp.com) to embed tracking tokens, then Postmark provides that token in “MailboxHash.” You can use that to locate the correct existing thread.
  - Alternatively, you might rely on “In‐Reply‐To” or “References” in the headers for matching.

## 3) Message Metadata (Critical for Processing Replies)

• MessageID
  - This is Postmark’s (or the sender’s mail client’s) unique ID for the inbound message.
  - You likely store it in your messages.messageId column so you can mark the conversation thread.

• InReplyTo / References
  - The actual inbound JSON includes these as part of the Headers array (or sometimes in Postmark’s “In-Reply-To” field if it’s present).
  - If you want to handle reply chains, you can store “inReplyTo” from the email’s headers in messages.inReplyTo.
  - This is useful for your system’s logic if you do anything with email threading or references.

## 4) Message Content

• StrippedTextReply
  - When a customer *replies* to a message, Postmark tries to give you just the new reply text that the user wrote (i.e. minus any quoted previous content).
  - This is often the best field to store in messages.content (for inbound replies) because it’s nice and clean.
  - If it’s empty (meaning the message wasn’t recognized as a reply), you can fall back to “TextBody” (plain text) or “HtmlBody.”

• TextBody / HtmlBody
  - If StrippedTextReply is missing or incomplete, you may want to parse “TextBody” or “HtmlBody.”
  - You can decide whether you prefer to store HTML or plain text.
  - In your schema, messages.content is a text field—so you might store plain text, or store HTML if that’s what your agent UI expects.

## 5) Attachments

• Attachments array
  - Each file has:
    1. Name (filename)
    2. Content (base64‐encoded)
    3. ContentType (MIME type)
    4. ContentLength (size)
    5. ContentID (if inline)

  - If you want to keep attachments, you likely:
    - Create rows in your “files” table for each attachment, storing size, name, and MIME type.
    - Decode the base64 “Content” and upload it to your storage (e.g., S3), then store that URL in files.url.
    - Reference the file’s ID in messages.fileId if you want to associate it with the newly created “message.”

## 6) Other Possibly Useful Headers

• ReplyTo
  - If your customers specify a different reply‐to email, you might store or use it to route your replies.
  - Usually, though, you’ll key off the “From” field for the customer.

• Cc / Bcc (and ToFull, CcFull, BccFull)
  - If you need to track other recipients or show them in the UI, you can parse these.
  - Often less important for a simple help desk, but you can store them if you need to.

• Headers (SpamAssassin, DKIM, SPF, etc.)
  - Postmark includes these (e.g., X‐Spam‐Score). You don’t necessarily need them unless you want to do your own spam filtering or diagnostics.

## Putting It All Together

A typical workflow for handling inbound email via Postmark’s webhook:

1. Receive the inbound JSON from Postmark.
2. Extract:
   – fromEmail = FromFull.Email
   – fromName = FromFull.Name
   – messageId = MessageID
   – subject = Subject
   – strippedReply = StrippedTextReply (fallback to TextBody/HtmlBody if missing)
   – mailboxHash = MailboxHash (optional, if you use plus‐addresses)
   – inReplyTo = gleaned from the Headers array if present.
   – attachments array (if any).
3. Find or create a “customer” row (where email = fromEmail). Update the name if you’d like.
4. Find or create a “thread” row. Possibly match by mailboxHash or a token in the subject. Otherwise, create a brand‐new thread with subject = Subject, customerId = customer.id.
5. Insert a row in “messages” with:
   – type = 'email'
   – messageId = postmark’s MessageID
   – inReplyTo = the header’s In‐Reply‐To if you use that for threading, else null
   – content = strippedReply (or fallback)
   – customerId = your new or existing customer’s ID
   – threadId = the found or created thread ID
   – userClerkId = null (because it’s from the customer)
   – timestamps (created_at, etc.).
6. For each attachment:
   – Decode and store it in your “files” table, or upload to S3, etc.
   – If you use your “messages.fileId” as a single reference, you might store only one file or create a separate table to link multiple attachments.

Since you mentioned staff do not respond via email clients, your “messages.type = 'staff'” entries won’t need an SMTP “messageId” or “inReplyTo.” Instead, your internal help desk UI will have staff compose messages that you store with type = 'staff', userClerkId set, and no customerId.

By capturing this minimal set of Postmark fields in your schema, you have enough context to:
• Correctly identify or create the customer.
• Attach the message to the right thread.
• Show the text/HTML body to your staff in the help desk UI.
• Let staff respond from the UI, storing their response as a “staff” message.
• (Optionally) send an outbound email to the customer (via Postmark) notifying them that the staff has replied—although that’s an entirely separate process from the inbound parse.

This covers the core fields you need to save so you can display the inbound email within your help desk and allow staff to respond from your UI.
